               <h9>  This brand new Phase III development is happening in the tech corridor of city of Kitchener. Located in the downtown core.

                <h9> We are currently featuring pre-construction condos located in Kitchener, Ontario in the downtown core. We have studio efficiency units and 1 bdr upto 2 bedrooms. The building is literally across the new Google building! Google is slated to hire high income earners in its new offices! It is close to University of Toronto School of Pharmacy and McMaster University Medical College. All these features lend themselves to a good investment grade project. It provides a terrific upside potential for renting it to I.T. and medical professionals</h9>
